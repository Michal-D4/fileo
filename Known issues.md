# Known issues

Two issues related to Linux. I am not going to solve them because Linux is mostly command line OS and there is many different [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) and window managers (choice problem). 

1. I haven't packaged app to deploy in Linux, you may install it from PyPi.
2. I couldn't set an app icon in Linux, Fedora, Wayland.
